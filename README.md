<b>Topic Modeling:</b><br><br>
Within NLU, which is a part of NLP, one of the many tasks that can be performed is
extracting the meaning of a sentence, a paragraph, or a whole document. One approach
to understanding a document is through its topics. For example, if a set of documents
is from a newspaper, the topics might be politics or sports. With topic modeling
techniques, we can obtain a bunch of words representing various topics. Depending
on your set of documents, you will then have different topics represented by different
words. The goal of these techniques is to know the different types of documents in your
corpus.
